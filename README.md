# 86List

## Overview

86List is a community for service-industry professionals to talk about the clients that they serve. This idea surfaced during a conversation with my neighbor, a career, high-end bartender. He mentioned that while guests can rate restaurants, restaurants can't rate guests. 86List is a place where servers and bartenders at a specific restaurant/eatery can talk about the clients that they serve and rate them. The title is a play on words, as '86' is the way to say 'get rid of' or 'without'. So this is geared towards guests they'd rather 86.

## MVP

- Leverage Ruby on Rails for full CRUD
- Link the backend to Postresql
- Link Restaurants to Users and Posts to both Users and Restaurants
- Leverage React.js to create a simple, clean and elegant UI

## PostMVP

- Allow users to login in order to see only their Restaurant
- Create the ability to add comments to posts
- Require authorization for users to access their specific locations
- Require authorization for users to post and comment
- Create an admin login to see and manipulate the data for restraunts and locations (for apporval) and users

## Code Showcase

- I've been quite pleased with my comfort with ternaries this time around. I leveraged a few for small 1%'s that make the UX even better.

```
{props.image_url ?
          <img className="post-attr" id="post-image" src={props.image_url} alt="user-generated" />
          :
          null
        }
```

```
<div id="post-card-button-container">
          <NavLink id="post-card-edit-link" to={`/posts/${props.post_id}/edit`}><button id="post-card-edit-button">Edit</button></NavLink>
          <button id="post-card-delete-button" onClick={handleShow}>Delete</button>

          <Modal show={show} onHide={handleClose}>
            <Modal.Header closeButton>
              <Modal.Title>Â¡Alert!</Modal.Title>
            </Modal.Header>
            <Modal.Body>Are you sure you want to delete this post? This action cannot be undone.</Modal.Body>
            <Modal.Footer>
              <Button variant="primary" autoFocus onClick={handleClose}>
                Close
              </Button>
              <Button variant="danger" onClick={() => handleDelete(props.post_id)}>
                Yes, Delete
              </Button>
            </Modal.Footer>
          </Modal>
```

## Code Issues & Resolutions

- It was tough to figure out the associations between tables for making posts.
- I am still working my way through creating new users.
